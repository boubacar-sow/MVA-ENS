Introduction Altegrad:
Validation: 40% labs (individually) 3/7 will be graded(randomly)
	    60% Data challenge -> groups of at most 3 (kaggle score (30%), report/code (25%), oral presentation(50%) 30min, the challenge will be started around the beginning of november.
	    
Centrality in networks:
Pagerank: a page has a higher pagerank if the number of pages pointing to it is high.
K-core decomposition: K-core of a graph is a maximal subgraph in which each node has at least degree k. In other words it's a subgraph where each node is connected to at least k other nodes in the subgraph

Comparison between TF-IDF and BM-25:
Bm-25 incorporates a document length normalization factor not present in classical TF-IF. This factor helps prevent long documents from getting high scores simply because they have more words. In practice BM-25 is often preferred to TF-IDF as it has better performance.

Comparison between pagerank and k-core decomposition
Pagerank is used to measure the importance of nodes in a network
K-core decomposition helps in understanding the structure of complex networks and identifying nodes that are highly connected. The output of pagerank is a score. The higher the score, the more important the node is considered. K-core outputs a set of subgraphs. Pagerank is more about ranking nodes based on their importance in a network while k-core decomposition is about understanding the structure of a network and identifying dense commnunities in it.


RNN for machine translation.
Structure of RNNs


Transformers:
Encoder: give an input to the encoder

Different layers of attentions mechanism in the encoder.


Decoder: we give the input that we already know.
